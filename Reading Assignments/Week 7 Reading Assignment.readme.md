###Week 7 Reading Assignment: "Parking search caused congestion: Where’s all the fuss?"
Can your GPS make a spot appear out of thin air? Adam Millard-Ball says no, but the circling associated with cruising can be carefully tracked. I found this article fascinating because of the surveillance mechanisms that provide such close measurements of human behavior—the paper points to internal and external validity elements. The authors mention some of the individual-level confounders like deciding to park a block away or missing a turn in addition to external factors like the difficulties attached to parking near a (perhaps poorly planned) heavily trafficked intersection. Bikes, cars, and GPS data all know our plights. It had never occurred to me that every vehicle on the road is looking for parking. It just happens to be a not so simple percentage of total vehicle traffic that is choosing to park simultaneously that creates congestion. Cruising is a science, and as a parker myself, I have observed variances in search patterns on busy streets that slow down traffic. For somewhat obvious reasons, unnecessarily spending energy, resources, and time is seldom wanted; however, I am curious about the political implications of cruising. 1) What does alleviating some of this congestion look like? 2) How have some studies managed to look at how many times people are likely to pass an open parking space before finding another? 3)If it is more helpful to represent cruising as a percentage of total vehicle traffic from a policy perspective, what is the alternative way more convenient for planners? 4)What is wrong with slightly overestimating the amounts of cruising? 5) Have you seen significant differences with the more stringent measurements?
