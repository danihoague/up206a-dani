***Week 3 Reading Assignment with Professor Geoff Boeing***

My reaction to Boeing’s work is to utilize OSMnx to tell stories about the historical inequalities manifesting in pollution burdens, similar to how he included complex analyses of public health into his network design article. Boeing’s essay “The Recent Revolution of American Street Network and Design” aligns closely with the public health and environmental justice lens that I want to carry on from my time in our course. When Boeing stated that, “today urban planners work in cities choked with automobile gridlock, face intertwined public health crises from physical inactivity and environmental pollution,”; it is reifying the deep dependence on past planners as much as we have on future planners (Boeing, 10). In his article displaying the OSMnx tool, I assume that the network measurement of street density will be a helpful tool to use in our project. We hope to visualize the impacted nature of census tracts that are more affected by pollution, and the history of assumed mobility in south-central LA engenders future challenges. We could infer a higher street density stemming from the number of nodes in a network by layering multiple factors in our maps. By examining OSMnx, we can better understand the histories of Los Angeles' design failures that negatively impact our study areas because we want to quantitatively and qualitatively understand how learning abilities and mental health outcomes arise from degraded environments. Vintage estimation measures supported by OSMnx can tell stories of resilience, past, and present (Boeing, 136). I plan to utilize aspects of elasticity to become an examiner of mobility needs. As a scholar of environmental justice, it is crucial to analyze spaces to organize sustainable futures temporally.

**Questions**
1. After recognizing the deep need for your measurement tools in the field of urban planning, how did you see OSMnx take off? 
2. What has been the most meaningful project that you have worked on in collaboration with your colleagues since the development of your tool?
3. What is your biggest hope for future urban planners who use OSMnx?
