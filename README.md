## On this page, I will be combining my fields of study and looking at the construction of information about _blood lead level_ data mapping in Los Angeles.

Analyzing blood lead level data is important because:

	*Any amount of lead exposure is unsafe
	*The CDC estimates that ~ 2.5% of children in the US ages 0-6 years have an elevated blood lead level above the threshold of 5Âµg/dL
	*Lead can cause severe development issues for children
There are thousands of lead contamination cases that receive little to no media attention and funding for remediation!
