## On this page, I will be combining my fields of study and looking at the construction of information about ***blood lead level*** data mapping in Los Angeles.

Analyzing blood lead level data is important because:

	*Lead exposure is unsafe at any level..
	*The CDC estimates that ~ 2.5% of children in the US ages 0-6 years have an elevated blood lead level above the threshold of 5Âµg/dL..
	*Lead can cause severe development issues for children..
